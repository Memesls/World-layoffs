# World-layoffs
SQL data standardization and data exploration for a world layoffs dataset.

This project aims to clean a raw dataset and calculate important metrics.

For the Data standardization part of this project, I:

1. Created a database in MySQL.
2. Imported the relevant data into the table.
3. Created a copy of the table to work on without any restrictions.
4. Deleted duplicate rows, standardized blank and null values, and filled in those that could be filled.

For the Data exploration part of this project, I calculated several key metrics. All are listed in the "Data_exploration.sql" file.
